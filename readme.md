Yet Another Chat App
====================

This is based on tbranyen's excellent [boiler-plate](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate/tree/amd) for NodeJS/Backbone projects.  I suggest everybody use that so I can have more people to ask questions of.

Last updated to https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate/commit/d19cc44d44cf1be933aaa28db1832a09aa825977

If someone knows a better way to merge in changes from another git project that's not really a fork, please let me know.

## Todo List ##
1. ~~rooms should use socket.io rooms to filter messages~~
2. ~~Some sort of user model~~
3. ~~Some sort of sessions~~
4. Get the text input to the bottom of the screen, with messages moving upwards
5. Room tab should indicate missed messages
6. Listing users in rooms
7. Indication of users typing
8. Adding custom rooms
9. Use MongoDB instead of Memory Store for sessions

Note: This is a list of various technologies I'd like to try out.  Just because they're crossed off doesn't mean they're done well.  In fact, it almost gaurantees they were done hastily and half-bakes so I could get that sweet, sweet rush of crossing something off a list.
